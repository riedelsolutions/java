# Java Projects


Old Java practice projects I come back to, when I need to refresh my memory.

#### [Stanford 193A](https://github.com/riedelsolutions/java/tree/master/Stanford%20193A)

Code I wrote for the apps while I followed Stanford's 193A Course.


#### Helsinki MOOC (to be added)

Old exercises I did for Part I and II of the renowned Helsinki Java MOOC.
